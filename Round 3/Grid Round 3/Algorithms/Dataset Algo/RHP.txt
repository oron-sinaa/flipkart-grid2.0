Image of MC 1st: Pins used

Reference: rx/tx connects to sbus, gives all data to rx/tx

rx/tx controlled by microcontroller; controller has the algorithm




LVc - Current Length of Vector 

K - Depends on body inertia; determined by experimentaion





Vx1 ; Vx2 -> approching zero
