After successful take off of the drone, we go through the following steps for trip management:


*Step.1 

Gathering data from the AI-Cam


*Step.2

Correction Algorithm


*Step.3

Find centre(s) of the corresponding gate(s)


*Step.4

Alignment Algorithm
Centre the drone through PID


*Step.5

IR PID loop to avoid collision while passing through gates
